# Inspired by:
https://daler.github.io/sphinxdoc-test/includeme.html

Edit the index.rst file

make html
make latexpdf
then in the _build/html folder,
gv _build/latex/TheCannon.pdf 
(or)
firefox _build/html/index.html

# workflow

In the TheCannon directory, edit and commit code in the TheCannon and code
directory as usual.
Edit sphinx documentation in the TheCannon/docs directory
document stuff in README.rst, commit it as usual
document stuff that will be in the documentation but not on the main page, 
in other .rst files in the docs directory

In the docs directory, run 'make html' to generate html docs 
make latexpdf, push that commit that if you want
git push origin master

change to the TheCannon-docs repo, html directory
git branch to make sure you're on gh-pages
git commit -am "rebuilt docs"
git push origin gh-pages

done!
