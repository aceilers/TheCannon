``TheCannon`` can be installed using ``pip``:

    $ pip install TheCannon

Here is an overview of the basic workflow using a simple illustration 
with APOGEE DR10 data in which the test set is identical to the training set.
To run this example, download the file ``example_DR10.tar.gz`` by clicking 
:download:`here <example_DR10.tar.gz>`
and unzip it using the command

    $ tar -zxvf example_DR10.tar.gz

This file contains the following:

* ``Data``: a folder with .fits data files
* ``reference_labels.csv``: a table with reference label values for the training step

Before the data can be run through ``TheCannon``, it must be prepared
according to the specifications laid out in the "Requirements for Input"
section. One of the requirements is for data to be continuum normalized
in a SNR-independent way. ``TheCannon`` does have built-in 
options for continuum normalizing spectra, and we illustrate that here.

Here are the steps for reading in the data. In practice, the user would
write his own code; for this example, we provide the module ``apogee.py``. 
The procedure for reading in spectra and training labels of course depends on
the survey, the file type, etc, and it is up to the user to package this
all appropriately before feeding it into ``TheCannon``.

>>> from TheCannon import apogee
>>> tr_ID, wl, tr_flux, tr_ivar = apogee.load_spectra("example_DR10/Data")
>>> tr_label = apogee.load_labels("example_DR10/reference_labels.csv")

There should be 548 spectra with 8575 pixels each. 

For simplicity, we set the test set is set as equal to the training set, so that
``TheCannon`` is simply re-determining labels for the reference objects. In
practice, the test IDs, fluxes, and inverse variances would be read in 
separately.

>>> test_ID = tr_ID
>>> test_flux = tr_flux
>>> test_ivar = tr_ivar

Now, all the input data has been packaged properly, and we can begin running
``TheCannon.``

The first step is to initialize a ``Dataset`` object:

    >>> from TheCannon import dataset
    >>> ds = dataset.Dataset(
    >>> ...wl, tr_ID, tr_flux, tr_ivar, tr_label, test_ID, test_flux, test_ivar)

``TheCannon`` has a number of optional diagnostic plots built-in, to help the
user visualize the results. Some of these plots require knowing the names
of the labels. If the user wants to produce these diagnostic plots, he or
she must specify the label names in LaTeX format: 

    >>> ds.set_label_names(['T_{eff}', '\log g', '[Fe/H]'])

At this stage, two diagnotic plots can already be produced, 
one with the distribution
of SNR in the training and test set (in practice, the training set 
should consist of higher SNR spectra than the test set) 
and the other using ``triangle.py`` to plot
every label's set of training values against every other.  

    >>> fig = ds.diagnostics_SNR()

.. image:: images/SNRdist.png

We can also plot the reference labels against each other:

    >>> fig = ds.diagnostics_ref_labels()

That figure should look like this:

.. image:: images/ref_labels_triangle.png

Again, ``TheCannon`` requires incoming spectra to be continuum normalized
in a way that is independent of signal to noise. If the data does not satisfy
this criteria already, the user can use the continuum identification and
normalization functions built into ``TheCannon``. 

First, continuum pixels are identified from a pseudo-continuum normalized
version of the training set spectra. Pseudo-continuum normalization is
performed using a running quantile. In this case, the
window size for calculating the median is set to 50 Angstroms and the quantile
level is set to 90\%. APOGEE spectra come in three chunks, and we want to
perform continuum normalization for each chunk separately. For ``TheCannon``
to treat spectra in chunks, the ``ranges`` attribute must be set:

    >>> ds.ranges = [[371,3192], [3697,5997], [6461,8255]]

Even if a spectral dataset do not consist of chunks separated by gaps, one can
imagine other reasons for wanting to treat a spectrum as though it had gaps:
for example, if different regions of a spectrum behave very differently, it
might be sensible to treat each of them separately in continuum normalization.
The user should make sure to examine the results of continuum normalization, 
for example plotting fifty sample continuum fits and continuum normalized 
spectra.

Pseudo continuum normalization can then be performed as follows:

    >>> pseudo_tr_flux, pseudo_tr_ivar = ds.continuum_normalize_training_q(
    >>> ...q=0.90, delta_lambda=50)

Once the pseudo continuum has been calculated, a continuum mask is created:
True values correspond to pixels that are continuum, False to those that are
not. "True" continuum pixels are identified using a median and variance flux
cut across the training objects: in other words, continuum pixels are those
that consistently have values close to 1 in all of the training spectra. The
user specifies what fraction of pixels to identify as continuum, and the
flux and variance cuts are determined appropriately. If the ``ds.ranges``
attribute is set, then continuum pixels are identified separately for each
region (in this case, three regions). This enables the user to control how
evenly spread the pixels are.

In this case, we choose 7% of the pixels in the spectrum as continuum, but the
best value should be determined through experimentation.

    >>> contmask = ds.make_contmask(
    >>> ...pseudo_tr_flux, pseudo_tr_ivar, frac=0.07)

At this stage, the user should plot spectra overlaid with the identified
continuum pixels to ensure that they look reasonable and that they roughly
evenly cover the spectrum. Large gaps in continuum pixels could result in
poor continuum normalization in those regions. If the continuum pixels
do not look evenly sampled enough, the range can be changed and the process
repeated. For this example, we change it as follows:

    >>> ds.ranges = [[371,3192], [3697,5500], [5500,5997], [6461,8255]]
    >>> contmask = ds.make_contmask(
    >>> ...pseudo_tr_flux, pseudo_tr_ivar, frac=0.07)

Once a satisfactory set of continuum pixels has been identified, the dataset's
continuum mask attribute is set as follows:

    >>> ds.set_continuum(contmask)

Once the dataset has a continuum mask, the continuum is fit for using either
a sinusoid or chebyshev function. In this case, we use a sinusoid; the user
can specify the desired order. Again, this is 3 for this simple illustration,
but should be determined through experimentation.

    >>> cont = ds.fit_continuum(3, "sinusoid")

Once a satisfactory continuum has been fit, the normalized training and test
spectra can be calculated:

    >>> norm_tr_flux, norm_tr_ivar, norm_test_flux, norm_test_ivar = \
    >>> ds.continuum_normalize(cont)

If these normalized spectra look acceptable, then they can be set:

    >>> ds.tr_flux = norm_tr_flux
    >>> ds.tr_ivar = norm_tr_ivar
    >>> ds.test_flux = norm_test_flux
    >>> ds.test_ivar = norm_test_ivar

Now, the data munging is over and we're ready to run ``TheCannon``!

For the training step (fitting for the spectral model) all the user needs to 
specify is the desired polynomial order of the spectral model. 
In this case, we use a quadratic model: order = 2

>>> from TheCannon import model
>>> md = model.CannonModel(2) 
>>> md.fit(ds) 

At this stage, more optional diagnostic plots can be produced to examine
the spectral model:

>>> md.diagnostics_contpix(ds)
>>> md.diagnostics_leading_coeffs(ds)
>>> md.diagnostics_plot_chisq(ds)

The first is a series of plots showing the full baseline (first-order) model
spectrum with continuum pixels overplotted. 

.. image:: images/contpix.gif

The second is a plot of the leading coefficients and scatter of the model
as a function of wavelength

.. image:: images/leading_coeffs.png

The third is a histogram of the reduced chi squareds of the model fit. 

.. image:: images/modelfit_chisqs.png

If the model fitting worked, then we can proceed to the test step. This 
command automatically updates the dataset with the fitted-for test labels,
and returns the corresponding covariance matrix.

>>> label_errs = md.infer_labels(ds)

You can access the new labels as follows:

>>> test_labels = ds.test_label_vals

A set of diagnostic output:

>>> ds.diagnostics_test_step_flagstars()
>>> ds.diagnostics_survey_labels()

The first generates one text file for each label, called ``flagged_stars.txt``. 
The second generates a triangle plot of the survey (Cannon) labels,
shown below.

.. image:: images/survey_labels_triangle.png

If the test set is simply equivalent to the training set, 
as in this example, then one final diagnostic plot can be produced:  

>>> ds.diagnostics_1to1()

.. image:: images/1to1_label_0.png

.. image:: images/1to1_label_1.png

.. image:: images/1to1_label_2.png
